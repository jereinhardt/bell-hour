# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        Here is where you may setup the accounts for all of the users who will be 
        using the app. Please fill in their information, and we will send them an 
        invitation to complete their account and join your school on Bell Hour. 
        Please provide at least an email address, their department, and whether 
        they should be considered a teacher or admin.  Be sure to note that a user 
        should only be marked as a teacher if their department is a grade. 
        (That does not include departments such as Art, Music, or Gym.) 
        No users marked as a teacher should also be marked as an admin. Admin is 
        only for faculty members in the office.
